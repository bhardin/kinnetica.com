    <a href="/projects/jekyll-sitemap-generator/">Jekyll Plugin: Sitemap.xml Generator</a><br />
    <p class="sub-project">This plugin traverses all the pages and posts within a Jekyll site and creates a sitemap.xml file within the _sites folder. The sitemap.xml file is deployed along with your site and submitted to search engines to ensure that crawlers can find all of your pages. The sitemap.xml file can also provide additional metadata to crawlers, such as the last modified date, change frequency, and relative importance of each page to your site.</p>
