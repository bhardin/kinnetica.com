    <p class="sub-project">This plugin will traverse all the pages and posts within a Jekyll site while the site is regenerated and create a sitemap.xml file within the _sites/ folder. The sitemap.xml file is deployed along with your site and submitted to search engines to ensure that search engines can find all of your pages, as well as provide additional metadata about each page.</p>
